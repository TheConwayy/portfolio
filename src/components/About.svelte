		Hey there!
		<br />
		<br />
		My name is Devin Conway. I am a teenager that live in the <em>somewhat</em> beautiful state of
		Michigan with my family that happens to have a huge interest in technology and simulation.
		<br />
		I was introduced to technology around the age of 7, where I decided I would be the coolest kid on
		the block and set myself up with an email (with help from someone else, of course). I then got a
		book on "HTML & CSS for Dummies" and decided there that I wanted to have a career in something related
		to computer programming.
		<br />
		<br />
		I now manage my local area chamber of commerce's website and am starting my own freelance company
		"Conway Development" where I will be creating many different things, such as websites like this,
		discord bots, and other misc. things.
		<br />
		Hopefully, with me learning Svelte (what this website was made with), I can make more interactive
		websites. But I am also learning ways to expand my knowledge in all areas.
